# HORUS Bridge

## Overview

HORUS Bridge is the essential desktop component of the HORUS mixed reality robotics platform. This server acts as a vital link, facilitating communication, data exchange, and control commands between the HORUS interface (running on the Meta Quest 3) and the connected robot(s).

## Key Functionalities

* **Real-time Teleoperation Data Relay:** Transmits control inputs from the HORUS interface to the robot and streams sensor data back for visualization.
* **Robot Network Management:** Establishes and maintains connections with individual robots within the team.
* **Data Translation:** Adapts data formats and communication protocols to ensure compatibility between the headset and robots.
* **API for HORUS Interface:** Provides an API endpoint for the main HORUS interface to send control commands and receive robot data.

## Installation and Usage


## Project Timeline _(Road to version 0.1.0)_

- [x] Robot Communication Stub:
    - [x] Choose a lightweight method to simulate basic robot interactions (this could even be a simple script generating mock data initially).
    - [x] Implement a module to receive data from this "robot".
- [x] WebSocket Server:
    - [x] Set up a core WebSocket server (ws library in Node.js, websockets in Python, etc.).
    - [x] Establish basic connection handling with the HORUS interface.
- [ ] Data Relaying:
    - [ ] Translate simplified robot data (camera images, control commands) into a format suitable for WebSocket transmission.
    - [ ] Implement relay logic to send/receive data between the WebSocket connection and the robot communication module.
