# HORUS Bridge

## Overview

HORUS Bridge is the essential desktop component of the HORUS mixed reality robotics platform. This server acts as a vital link, facilitating communication, data exchange, and control commands between the HORUS interface (running on the Meta Quest 3) and the connected robot(s).

## Key Functionalities

* **Real-time Teleoperation Data Relay:** Transmits control inputs from the HORUS interface to the robot and streams sensor data back for visualization.
* **Robot Network Management:** Establishes and maintains connections with individual robots within the team.
* **Data Translation:** Adapts data formats and communication protocols to ensure compatibility between the headset and robots.
* **API for HORUS Interface:** Provides an API endpoint for the main HORUS interface to send control commands and receive robot data.
